    <h2>About Narvik</h2>
    <p>
      After the German invasion of Norway in World War II, combat broke out in and around Narvik. This conflict is known as the Battle of Narvik. Due to the shipping of iron ore from the northern Swedish mines, and because the Gulf of Bothnia freezes over in the winter, Narvik was tactically significant to Germany and the Allies. Iron ore was particularly crucial to the war industry, making it crucial for the Allies to stop its transit to Germany. Iron ore was also crucial to the British war industry.

    <p>
      The Battle of Narvik took place in a remote, hostile region with few roads and provisions, inclement weather, darkness, and on steep mountainsides that descended toward the fjord arms. At most, the German force had 6,000 troops, compared to 24,000 in the Allied forces. There were also 8,000-10,000 Norwegians. However, no one won or lost when the events were over.

  <section> <!-- The Defeat of Germany -->
    <h2>The defeat of Nazi Germany</h2>
    <p>
      The Red Army stormed into Berlin in May 1945 and seized control of the capital, putting an end to the Third Reich and the European theater of World War II. But who contributed the most to winning World War Two? The judgment on the image among historians is debatable. While it is true that Soviet troops made the greatest contributions on the battlefield and suffered the greatest losses, American and British air campaigns, as well as the US supply of weapons and equipment through lend-lease, were also very important.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Germany was occupied by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allies from the west following the Allied assault on France, and on May 8, 1945, it submitted. Hitler's reluctance to accept defeat resulted in extensive infrastructure destruction in Germany and more casualties from the war in its final months.
